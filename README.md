## Tools used in the App
### Node.js
I used to node.js in the development and production of my app. Every time you open the server application in Visual studio Code in your local machine, you have to start the server by using the Node.js command: `npm start server`. Prior to that, you need to make sure you download and install Node.js in your computer and install Node.js for the server application you are working on by the terminal command: `npm install`. You can get Node.js for your computer from the following link: https://nodejs.org/en/
### Heroku: Cloud Application Platform
I used Heroku: Cloud Application Platform for deploying my app into the internet through a GitHub repository. This platform supports many development languages including Node.js and it is a free service to anyone. 
### Express
I used Express as a framework of Node.js for the development of the server that hosts the web app. We created a custom API with Express in our server and used it to access information from the server using a API Fetch from the client side. You can install express in your server application by using the terminal command: `npm install express`. You can learn more about Express from this link: http://expressjs.com/

### Cookie-session
We used cookie-session to create cookies in our browser. These cookies ensured that only authenticated users have access to the dashboard services. You can install cookie-session through Node.js in your server application by using the following terminal code: `npm install cookie-session`
